## What is this?

vᴀꜱᴛly is a toolkit for handling expression ASTs (such as those produced by [JSEP](https://ericsmekens.github.io/jsep/)).
These ASTs are a subset of ASTs produced by full-blown parsers like [Esprima](https://esprima.org/).

Intended to be used in conjunction with [JSEP](https://ericsmekens.github.io/jsep/), but should work with any AST that conforms to the same structure.

Extracted from [Mavo](https://mavo.io).
